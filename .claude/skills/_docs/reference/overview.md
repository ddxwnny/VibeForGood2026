## State Management Files

- **`docs/workflow-status.md`** - Tracks current phase, progress, next actions
- **`docs/sprint-status.yaml`** - Tracks all stories with statuses (backlog → drafted → in-progress → review → done)

## Conversational Triggers

Each skill has natural language triggers that Claude detects automatically:

| What You Say | Skill Invoked | What Happens |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| "I have an idea...", "What if we...", "Help me think through..." | `bmad-discovery-research` | Brainstorming and product brief creation |
| "I want to build...", "Create a PRD", "Plan this feature" | `bmad-product-planning` | PRD and epics generation |
| "What should the UI look like?", "Design the UX" | `bmad-ux-design` | UX specification and design thinking |
| "How should we build this?", "What's the architecture?" | `bmad-architecture-design` | Technical architecture and stack decisions |
| "How should we test?", "Create test strategy" | `bmad-test-strategy` | Test framework and ATDD implementation |
| "Break into stories", "Create user stories" | `bmad-story-planning` | Developer-ready story file creation |
| "Implement story X", "Develop this feature", "Let's code" | `bmad-development-execution` | Code implementation with tests |
| "What's next?", "Where am I?", "Start new project" | `main-workflow-router` | Workflow status and guidance |

**Claude analyzes your message intent and context**, then invokes the appropriate skill automatically.
