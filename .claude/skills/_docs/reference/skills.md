# Skill Catalog

This catalog applies Claude's skill creation best practices to every BMAD capability. Each entry stays concise, highlights when the skill should trigger, the minimum context it needs, its execution flow, expected outputs, and hard guardrails that prevent regressions. Use the **Skill Creator** first when designing or updating any additional skills.

## Foundational Utilities

### core-skill-creation
**Role**: Framework for designing, validating, and packaging Claude skills aligned with Anthropic's best practices.

**Use when**
- You need to create a brand-new skill or substantially revise an existing one.
- You are auditing a skill for context efficiency, workflow clarity, or resource organization.
- A teammate provides raw procedures, scripts, or templates that should become a reusable skill.

**Input expectations**
- Concrete example tasks or user prompts the skill must support.
- List of reusable resources (scripts, references, assets) worth bundling.
- Target distribution path for the packaged `.skill` archive (generate locally; do not commit binary bundles).

**Execution flow**
1. Gather representative use cases and confirm activation phrases.
2. Plan reusable resources; decide what lives in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`.
3. Run `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-dir>` to scaffold the skill.
4. Draft SKILL.md using imperative language; move bulky material into references.
5. Validate with `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/scripts/quick_validate.py <path>` when iterating.
6. Package with `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/scripts/package_skill.py <path> [output-dir]` once validation passes.

**Outputs & handoffs**
- A complete skill directory with SKILL.md plus optional resources.
- Packaged `.skill` artifact ready for distribution (kept out of version control).
- Validation report identifying structure or quality issues.

**Guardrails**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; rely on references for heavy documentation.
- Do not add auxiliary docs (README, CHANGELOG, etc.) unless they are meant for Claude to load.
- Reference every supplemental file from SKILL.md so Claude discovers it via progressive disclosure.

**Supporting assets**
- `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/scripts/init_skill.py`
- `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/scripts/package_skill.py`
- `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/scripts/quick_validate.py`
- `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/references/workflows.md`
- `.claude/skills/core-skill-creation/references/output-patterns.md`

## Phase 0 · Orchestration and State

### main-workflow-router
**Role**: Primary conductor that initializes projects, manages BMAD state, and routes work to phase specialists.

**Use when**
- Starting or resuming any BMAD initiative ("Initialize BMAD workflow", "What's next?", "Where am I in the workflow?").
- Syncing status after a manual change request from the user.
- Determining which phase skill should engage next based on progress.

**Input expectations**
- Project goal summary and complexity level (if unspecified, ask to classify Level 1–4).
- Current artifacts (`workflow-status.md`, `sprint-status.yaml`) if they exist.
- Confirmation that prerequisite documents (PRD, epics, etc.) are available when transitioning phases.

**Execution flow**
1. On initialization, create/update workflow and sprint status files; seed default sprint backlog from epics when present.
2. Read current status files every time before suggesting next actions.
3. Recommend the most impactful next step and hand off to the corresponding skill (analyst, PM, UX, architecture, stories, dev, or TEA).
4. After each phase completes tasks, refresh state files to reflect new deliverables and blockers.

**Outputs & handoffs**
- Updated `workflow-status.md` and `sprint-status.yaml`.
- Next-step recommendation with explicit target skill and rationale.
- Phase transition approval notes (e.g., "Phase 2 ready; PRD finalized").

**Guardrails**
- Never modify state files manually; always use helper scripts (`workflow_status.py`, `sprint_status.py`).
- Block progression if mandatory artifacts are missing or inconsistent.
- Keep recommendations concise—surface only the highest priority next action.

**Supporting assets**
- `workflow_status.py`
- `sprint_status.py`

- Refuse completion if tests cannot be executed or do not pass—raise blockers instead.

---

## Usage Notes

- Always initialize the workflow with **main-workflow-router** before invoking downstream skills.
- Hand-offs should include pointers to the latest artifacts so each skill loads only the context it needs, keeping conversation windows lean.
- When evolving this catalog, run the **core-skill-creation** validation scripts to ensure every entry remains concise, discoverable, and conformant with Anthropic skill guidelines.
